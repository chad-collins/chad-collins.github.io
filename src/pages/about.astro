			<h2>Hey, I'm Chad</h2>
			<p>
				I'm a dad, software developer, tinkerer, reader, and sometimes
				Pokémon trainer. In 2025 I decided to officially ditch social
				media and avoid shorts, reels, TikToks, and basically anything
				designed to melt your attention span. Instead of doom scrolling,
				I’ve been spending more time on hobbies, picking up new ones,
				and doing things that feel a little more meaningful. I’ve always
				been a jack of all trades, master of none, which makes writing
				about the things I love a little intimidating. This blog is my
				way of thinking out loud, tracking what I’m into, and
				experimenting with ideas.
			</p>

			<p>
				I’m an Ohio guy, born in a rural town, dragged to Columbus by a
				relationship and a job, then eventually pulled back to the
				sticks by family. Still trying to recover from the whiplash.
			</p>

			<p>
				Guitar has been my longest-running hobby. I’ve played for 28
				years going on maybe 2, depending on how generous you’re
				feeling. I’ve got some nice toys, an American Tele and a Strat,
				but most days I’m just messing around on my little Taylor
				acoustic trying not to break it.
			</p>

			<p>
				I’m nostalgic for my childhood, especially handheld gaming. As
				an adult, that curiosity turned into tinkering, soldering,
				restoring, and fixing anything with chips and circuits. The
				funny thing is I’m completely worthless with real tools,
				engines, or anything involving actual DIY. I’m a nerd by nature,
				so I stick to the stuff that speaks in ones and zeros. There’s
				something magical about reviving a gross, half-dead console. A
				Game Boy with an OLED screen is ridiculous, yes, but I’ve done
				it and I would do it again in a heartbeat.
			</p>

			<p>
				Work-wise, I’m in the backend world with Java, building things
				that actually help people, which is meaningful. But my heart is
				in the front end. I’ve always loved design, from drawing to
				graphic work, and I could happily spend a full day tweaking font
				weights, spacing, or color palettes. It’s my version of
				meditation.
			</p>

			<p>
				This blog is part experiment, part memory log, and part excuse
				to have an internet presence after deleting social media from my
				life. It’s a place to collect my thoughts, track the projects I
				start (and sometimes never finish), and revisit ideas. Hopefully
				it’s useful, fun, or at least mildly entertaining. And maybe,
				just maybe, my daughter will read it one day and laugh at how
				weird her dad is.
			</p>
